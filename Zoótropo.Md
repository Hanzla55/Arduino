# ZOÃ“TROPO


### RESUMEN


I did this project with ANDREE. IN this project we made a circuit in which we connected a battery 


with motor because the arduino board only doesn't has enough power to run this circuit 


we also connected a button by which we can turn on and off the motor and also a potentiometer


by which we can control the speed of the motor.After that we put a paper made fan on the moter we painted different objects inside 


the fan so when the motor starts and the fan moves we can see a animation from the holes of the paper fan. The picture of fan is 


given below. As we know it's a Arduino project so 


cann't only be done by hardware so we also run the code given below in the circuit.
